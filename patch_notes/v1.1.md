### v1.1.0
- Support for [GAMEVERS](../docs/gamevers.md) lump in combination with [COMPLVL](../docs/complvl.md) to further specify Vanilla compatibility.
- Added new scaled fuzz effect for Spectres and invisibility effects in the software renderer ([Thanks Lovey](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-doom/pull/359))

### v1.1.1
- Support for `-limitremoving` or `-lr` to disable overflow errors and emulation under Vanilla compatibility
- "Linedefs w/o tags apply locally" (Default: no) - option to fix tag 0 maps
- "OpenGL blend animations" (Default: no) - enables crossfading animation frames for flats and textures

### v1.1.2
- "Play demos while in menus" (Default: yes) - allows for demos to play under the menu like in Vanilla
- "Pause after intermission" (Default: yes) - adds an additional pause before "entering" the next map _(this is disabled when playing or recording demos to avoid desync)_
- Added support for [widescreen](../docs/ws.md) lumps _(making secondary widescreen asset wads unnecessary)_
- Added support for extended HELP screens (`HELP01`-`HELP99`) for Doom 2 / Plutonia / TNT _(previously only accessible via Doom 1)_.
  - See an [example/overview](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/111465-boom-extended-help-screens-an-undocumented-feature/) of the feature.
- Add [animated backgrounds](../docs/animbg.md) and menu graphics support _(TITLEPIC, INTERPIC, M_DOOM, etc)_
- Simplified / Re-organised options menus

### v1.1.3
- Temporarily removed some code for the "Linedefs w/o tags apply locally" option, as it caused demo desyncs. (I plan on adding this back, once I find a way to integrate correctly for generalised actions)
- Port should be demo compatible for complevels 9-21 again

### v1.1.4
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed "Linedefs w/o tags apply locally" option to also work with generalised actions
  - Fixed animated `M_SKULL#` crash only when in OpenGL
- New Features
  - Support for new Statusbar elements *(Options > Status Bar / HUD > Status Indicators)*
    - **Berserk** - shows a cross near doomguy's face when active
    - **Armour** - shows a green/blue icon next to doomguy's face indicating the type of armour had
  - Support for 2 new HUD elements (`sml_berserk` / `sml_armor`) for [DSDAHUD](../docs/dsdahud.md) lump
  - Extra support for REKKR loaded as an IWAD
