### v1.1.0
- Support for [GAMEVERS](../docs/gamevers.md) lump in combination with [COMPLVL](../docs/complvl.md) to further specify Vanilla compatibility.
- Added new scaled fuzz effect for Spectres and invisibility effects in the software renderer ([Thanks Lovey](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-doom/pull/359))

### v1.1.1
- Support for `-limitremoving` or `-lr` to disable overflow errors and emulation under Vanilla compatibility
- "Linedefs w/o tags apply locally" (Default: no) - option to fix tag 0 maps
- "OpenGL blend animations" (Default: no) - enables crossfading animation frames for flats and textures

### v1.1.2
- "Play demos while in menus" (Default: yes) - allows for demos to play under the menu like in Vanilla
- "Pause after intermission" (Default: yes) - adds an additional pause before "entering" the next map _(this is disabled when playing or recording demos to avoid desync)_
- Added support for [widescreen](../docs/ws.md) lumps _(making secondary widescreen asset wads unnecessary)_
- Added support for extended HELP screens (`HELP01`-`HELP99`) for Doom 2 / Plutonia / TNT _(previously only accessible via Doom 1)_.
  - See an [example/overview](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/111465-boom-extended-help-screens-an-undocumented-feature/) of the feature.
- Add [animated backgrounds](../docs/animbg.md) and menu graphics support _(TITLEPIC, INTERPIC, M_DOOM, etc)_
- Simplified / Re-organised options menus

### v1.1.3
- Temporarily removed some code for the "Linedefs w/o tags apply locally" option, as it caused demo desyncs. (I plan on adding this back, once I find a way to integrate correctly for generalised actions)
- Port should be demo compatible for complevels 9-21 again

### v1.1.4
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed "Linedefs w/o tags apply locally" option to also work with generalised actions
  - Fixed animated `M_SKULL#` crash only when in OpenGL
- New Features
  - Support for new Statusbar elements *(Options > Status Bar / HUD > Status Indicators)*
    - **Berserk** - shows a cross near doomguy's face when active
    - **Armour** - shows a green/blue icon next to doomguy's face indicating the type of armour had
  - Support for 2 new HUD elements (`sml_berserk` / `sml_armor`) for [DSDAHUD](../docs/dsdahud.md) lump
  - Extra support for REKKR loaded as an IWAD

### v1.1.5
- Fixes and optimisations to Background / Menu Animation code
  - [Animation sequences](../docs/animbg.md) will not be displayed If lump order is incorrect (`start` must come before `end`)
    - Widescreen / original lumps will instead be displayed if incorrect
  - Animated backgrounds have been updated to use the `S_` and `E_` prefixes to match the menu graphics. *(also caused issues with corruption.wad)*
- Reverted back to DSDA Doom v0.27 release base
- Re-implemented some features from [DSDA Doom Dev Branch](/patch_notes/v0.28.md) with Kraflab's permission.
  - Fixed an issue with interpolation that could lead to a rubber-banding effect
  - Fixed flat tile scaling

### v1.1.6
- ENDOOM
  - Added option to switch between DSDA Doom "Terminal" or PrBoom's classic "window" style.
  - Added option to view 'only PWAD' ENDOOM
- "Pistol Start" Menu Option
  - Config option has 3 settings: "off", "session", "always"
  - "session" only sets pistol start for that current play session. Quitting will reset to "off"
  - `-pistolstart` argument now sets config to "session" *(This means it's possible to turn the argument off while in-game)*
- Animated widescreen / background revamp
  - Added support for animated `STBAR` and `STARMS`. [See here!](../docs/animbg.md)
  - Added support for animated extended help screens (`HELP01-HELP99`)
  - All background / menu animations now run at the same speed as the menu selector (`M_SKULL1/2`)
  - Lots of backend code optimisations for Background / Animation code
- Added new `icon` option for **Armour** hud element *(Status Bar / HUD > Status Indicators)*
  - This option may look nicer on custom statusbars

### v1.1.7
- Added Unity WAD check *(BFG Edition and Unity WADs are now detected separately)*
- Added a 'wait for keyboard press' for the terminal ENDOOM output on Windows
- Added and fixed MacOS and Linux support

### v1.1.8
- [Limit-Removing](../docs/limit_removing.md) overhaul (with documentation)
  - Now uses the `-complevel #r` format (complevels 0-4) [Thanks Maribo for the idea]
  - [COMPLVL](../docs/complvl.md) now specifies limit-removing, instead of using [GAMEVERS](../docs/gamevers.md)
  - The console will print if limit-removing is active
  - Example 1: `-complevel 2r` loads a wad in `complevel 2` with limit-removing
  - Example 2: `-complevel 2` loads a wad without limit-removing, and would overwrite a COMPLVL lump with `limit-removing`.
- "Skip IWAD Story Text" config option added (Default: no)
  - When turned on, the default IWAD story text will be skipped in a PWAD if the story text hasn't been replaced.
  - Uses 2 checks to determine the skip. 1) if the story text matches the default text for that current screen, and 2) if the map before the text screen has been replaced by the PWAD.
  - When loading only the IWAD, the default IWAD story text will **NOT** be skipped
  - Only works for Doom 1, Doom 2, Plutonia, and TNT text screens
  - The skip is completely disabled if `UMAPINFO`, `UDMF / ZDoom`, or `Heretic / Hexen` are detected
  - Disabled when recording / playing demos
- Game modifiers with "session" functionality
  - These include `pistol start`, `respawn`, `fast monsters`, `no monsters`, and `coop spawns`
  - Config options has 3 settings: "off", "session", "always"
  - Using arguments sets config options to "session", allowing them to be turned off in-game
- Automap zoom / scroll Improvements
  - Now alternates speeds based on the "Always Run" toggle (instead of always faster when pressing the "run" button)
  - Zoom speed is now separate from scroll speed
- ENDOOM no longer shows after playing or recording a demo
- Menus have been reorganised / simplified
  - "Demos / Emulation" has changed to "Gameplay / Demos", and now includes easy access to the new game modifier options
  - "General" has been decluttered a bit with some options moving to "Gameplay / Demos"
- Certain minor changes to Nyan Doom config options
  - "Pistol start" uses `dsda_pistol_start` to match DSDA-Doom (even though Nyan Doom has session functionality)
  - "Endoom Type" (`nyan_config_type_endoom`) has been swapped: `Terminal` (0), `Window` (1). The idea is that a `Fullscreen` option (2) may be coming in the future
- Implimented new features from DSDA-Doom [v0.28](/patch_notes/v0.28.md)
