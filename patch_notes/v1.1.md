### v1.1.0
- Support for [GAMEVERS](../docs/gamevers.md) lump in combination with [COMPLVL](../docs/complvl.md) to further specify Vanilla compatibility.
- Added new scaled fuzz effect for Spectres and invisibility effects in the software renderer ([Thanks Lovey](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-doom/pull/359))

### v1.1.1
- Support for `-limitremoving` or `-lr` to disable overflow errors and emulation under Vanilla compatibility
- "Linedefs w/o tags apply locally" (Default: no) - option to fix tag 0 maps
- "OpenGL blend animations" (Default: no) - enables crossfading animation frames for flats and textures

### v1.1.2
- "Play demos while in menus" (Default: yes) - allows for demos to play under the menu like in Vanilla
- "Pause after intermission" (Default: yes) - adds an additional pause before "entering" the next map _(this is disabled when playing or recording demos to avoid desync)_
- Added support for [widescreen](../docs/ws.md) lumps _(making secondary widescreen asset wads unnecessary)_
- Added support for extended HELP screens (`HELP01`-`HELP99`) for Doom 2 / Plutonia / TNT _(previously only accessible via Doom 1)_.
  - See an [example/overview](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/111465-boom-extended-help-screens-an-undocumented-feature/) of the feature.
- Add [animated backgrounds](../docs/animbg.md) and menu graphics support _(TITLEPIC, INTERPIC, M_DOOM, etc)_
- Simplified / Re-organised options menus

### v1.1.3
- Temporarily removed some code for the "Linedefs w/o tags apply locally" option, as it caused demo desyncs. (I plan on adding this back, once I find a way to integrate correctly for generalised actions)
- Port should be demo compatible for complevels 9-21 again

### v1.1.4
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed "Linedefs w/o tags apply locally" option to also work with generalised actions
  - Fixed animated `M_SKULL#` crash only when in OpenGL
- New Features
  - Support for new Statusbar elements *(Options > Status Bar / HUD > Status Indicators)*
    - **Berserk** - shows a cross near doomguy's face when active
    - **Armour** - shows a green/blue icon next to doomguy's face indicating the type of armour had
  - Support for 2 new HUD elements (`sml_berserk` / `sml_armor`) for [DSDAHUD](../docs/dsdahud.md) lump
  - Extra support for REKKR loaded as an IWAD

### v1.1.5
- Fixes and optimisations to Background / Menu Animation code
  - [Animation sequences](../docs/animbg.md) will not be displayed If lump order is incorrect (`start` must come before `end`)
    - Widescreen / original lumps will instead be displayed if incorrect
  - Animated backgrounds have been updated to use the `S_` and `E_` prefixes to match the menu graphics. *(also caused issues with corruption.wad)*
- Reverted back to DSDA Doom v0.27 release base
- Re-implemented some features from [DSDA Doom Dev Branch](/patch_notes/v0.28.md) with Kraflab's permission.
  - Fixed an issue with interpolation that could lead to a rubber-banding effect
  - Fixed flat tile scaling

### v1.1.6
- ENDOOM
  - Added option to switch between DSDA Doom "Terminal" or PrBoom's classic "window" style.
  - Added option to view 'only PWAD' ENDOOM
- "Pistol Start" Menu Option
  - Config option has 3 settings: "off", "session", "always"
  - "session" only sets pistol start for that current play session. Quitting will reset to "off"
  - `-pistolstart` argument now sets config to "session" *(This means it's possible to turn the argument off while in-game)*
- Animated widescreen / background revamp
  - Added support for animated `STBAR` and `STARMS`. [See here!](../docs/animbg.md)
  - Added support for animated extended help screens (`HELP01-HELP99`)
  - All background / menu animations now run at the same speed as the menu selector (`M_SKULL1/2`)
  - Lots of backend code optimisations for Background / Animation code
- Added new `icon` option for **Armour** hud element *(Status Bar / HUD > Status Indicators)*
  - This option may look nicer on custom statusbars

### v1.1.7
- Added Unity WAD check *(BFG Edition and Unity WADs are now detected separately)*
- Added a 'wait for keyboard press' for the terminal ENDOOM output on Windows
- Added and fixed MacOS and Linux support
