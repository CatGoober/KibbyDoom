### For the Future...
- [See planned features](/patch_notes/future.md)

### v1.2.0

**New Nyan Doom Features**
- Added new "Nyan Options" menu items with Nyan Doom exclusive features.
- "Skip IWAD Demos for PWADs" *(this will only play the PWAD internal demos... aka no more desynced MAP11 playing in the background :P )*
- Added advanced "Boom Translucency" menu and settings *(see section below)*
- "Flashing Item Bonuses" option to make it easier to see health and armour bonuses *(disabled if things or frames have been changed via DEHACKED)*
- Added experimental new "Enhanced Lite Amp Effect" option *(this should look nicer than the old fullbright alternative)*
- Added smart "Colored Blood" feature to add colored blood to Barons, Hell Knights, and Cacodemons *(only is applied if certain parts of the things haven't been altered via Dehacked)*
- Added option to allow the "tag finger" to be enabled if a computer area map has been found *(inspired by PrBoom X)*
- Now supports `NYANHUD` for exhud. (`DSDAHUD` can still be read if found, but `NYANHUD` has been added since Nyan Doom supports more widgets that DSDA Doom does not)
- Added options to disable [Animate](../docs/animbg.md) lumps, [Widescreen](../docs/ws.md) lumps, and Boom's dyanmic CREDIT / HELP screens

**New Customisable Translucency Options**
- Can be found in under "Nyan Options"
- Allows users to customise the default Boom translucency for things.
- Added "Translucency for Ghosts" Vanilla option
- Added "Vanilla Translucency" emulation option for adding translucency to things under Vanilla complevels

**Feature Improvements**
- Causal Game Modifiers *(Pistolstart, Respawn Monsters, No Monsters, Coop Spawns, etc)* are now saved in savegames / rewind *(note that old saves are incompatable)*
- [Animate](../docs/animbg.md) and [Widescreen](../docs/ws.md) lump support for UMAPINFO's `enterpic`, `exitpic`, `endpic`, and `interbackdrop` lumps
- "Skip IWAD Story Text" option now supports UMAPINFO / Heretic (whenever it gets full DEHACKED support)
- Changed automap "scroll / zoom" speeds to now be "pan / zoom" instead *(because this makes more sense)*
- Finally added [Animate](../docs/animbg.md) support for the scrolling bunny screens `PFUB1-2`
- Added snazzy new Nyan Doom dynamic CREDIT / HELP screens

**New Features also coming to DSDA Doom:**
- New "dark" translucent background overlay under menus (Nyan Doom includes extra settings such as "Overlay for all menus" and "Overlay gradual fade")
- Added "dark" overlay automap option (and automap now only uses automap extended hud)
- Added "Auto Switch Weapon on Pickup" Option (Casual Only of course)
- Completely reworked `READ ME!` / `HELP` routines to match Vanilla
- Added PWAD `HELP2` support when running Doom 1 under complevels 0-3
- Implemented Vanilla MainMenu for Heretic and Hexen
- Implemented `INFO` screens and routines for Heretic and Hexen
- Added Shareware Heretic (`Heretic1.wad`) support
- Automap "Pan / Zoom" speed based on "Always Run"

**Quality-of-Life**
- Added a new exhud widget `announce_message` which if in `NYANHUD` / `DSDAHUD` lump can be used to announce the map at the centre top of the screen (via "Announce Map On Entry" menu option).
- Added normal and subtle version of "Announce Map On Entry" *("On" setting uses `announce_message` widget to print text)*
- Renamed "Parallel Same-Sound Limit/Window" options to make more sense (and added an on/off toggle)
- Separated OpenGL-only "Nice Thing Icons" Automap option from "Things appearance" option
- Added subtle "Secret Revealed" message setting
- Add horizontal mouse wheel support.

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed a crucial demo recording desync bug relating to the "Play Demos Under Menus" option (if it was enabled)
- Berserk / Armor statusbar indicators are now printed on top of the Doomguy's mug
- Fixed an [Animate](../docs/animbg.md) bug with animations possibly desyncing by one frame after a certain amount of time
- Fixed "Show Alive Monsters" Option to make it clear that it's an OpenGL feature, and make sure it doesn't make monsters disappear when switching from OpenGL back to Software.
- Fixed Heretic / Hexen graphics to respect aspect ratio from "Statusbar and Menu Appearance"

**Other stuff**
- Menu messages can now be dismissed via BACKSPACE
- Add message feedback when trying to save your game at the wrong time (aka main menu and not in-game).
- Added 30 sec timeout to the terminal `nyan_endoom_wait` config option
- Fixed a crash when running Nyan Doom debug build
- Streamlined the options menu once again
