# Animated Background and Menu Support

Nyan Doom supports new animated background and menu graphics via specific lumps.

Only when both `start` and `end` animation lumps are present for a single entry, will those animation lumps take priority over the `original` lumps. Any lumps in-between the `start` and `end` lumps will also be included in the animation. Animations run at the same speed as the Menu Selector (`M_SKULL1/2`).

Note there are no [widescreen](ws.md) versions for these animated lumps as they take priority over widescreen lumps. The lump priority is: `start/end animations` > `widescreen` > `original`.

#### Please Note:
The `start` lumps should be placed *above* or *before* the `end` lumps in the WAD lump order. Failure to do so will result in the widescreen / original lumps being displayed instead.
- `Start` Lumps with the prefix `S_` mark the start the animation
- `End` Lumps with the prefix `E_` mark the end of animation

### Animated UMAPINFO Patches
Nyan Doom automatically truncates strings larger than 6 characters to fit the prefix `S_` or `E_` in the 8 character limit. Strings under than 6 characters won't be truncated.
